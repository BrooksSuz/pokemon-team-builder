# Paldea Pokemon Team Builder

## Brief Rundown:

This is my take on a pokemon team builder web application. This team builder focuses on the newest pokemon games within the Paldea region.

An issue that I have found with many other team builders is that they commonly have the pokemon data spread out across the web page. I find the user experience is hindered with this approach.

My app displays all of the information on one, unscrollable web page. The data the user will need is right in front of them at any given moment. The only scrollable element is the pokedex which contains all four hundred pokemon in the regonial Paldea pokedex.

The app uses Firebase for storing data in the backend.

## How to Use:

The app is pretty simple. You can scroll/search for a pokemon in the pokedex component. Click on the desired pokemon the pokemon party and type chart components will be filled with the respective pokemon's in-game information.

If the user would like to delete pokemon, they may click the "Delete Pokemon" button below the pokemon's name in their party. Or, if they want to delete their entire party, they can click the "Delete Entire Party" button at the top of the app.

If the user would like to save their parties, then they will have to create an account. A user can only have up to three parties per account. To save pokemon to a party, the user must click on the select element and choose the party option they would like to save the party to. Then simply click the "Save/Update Team" button to save or update their team. 

## Future QOL Updates: 

The app is currently only designed for desktop/laptop users. I intend on making it responsive to mobile users in the near future. I want to think about the best way to display the information on mobile devices while following the user experience philosophy that I covered in the Brief Rundown section.

I need to make the app "prettier". Currently it uses a lot of preset HTML styles. I am thinking about how I want the app to look.
